Which milestone(s) are you submitting? (Please check only one!)
  [*] HW1MS1
  [ ] HW1MS2

Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')
  Implemented taking all words in a ArrayList map.
  With each individual list in the map, we remove
  any case that is not in a-z or A-Z and make all
  letters into lowercase. Then, we remove any repeated
  elements. The words are then stored into Item item with
  its url and index, which
  will be in an ArrayList called queue. When queue reaches 25,
  the list is sent to the database. Any unprocessed lists will
  also be checked and entered in the database.
  
  With any remaining items in the queue are then sent to the
  the database after all items are iterated.

  ********************************************************************************
  *CODE PATCH*
    index.html:
    Line 16 changed the onsubmit to return the value from validate(term)
    Line 37 - 42 changed to return false for all blank strings as a keyword
    
    main.js:
    Line 56 added wordCount limit to data.Items.length because there could be
    less words than 15

    The problem of the code was not because it had data.Items as an array, but
    mainly because Line 16 did not return the value from validate(term)
